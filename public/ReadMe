Respected Sir/Mam,

I hope this message finds you well.

I am writing to inform you about an issue I encountered while working on the assignment you provided. The API key supplied for fetching movie data did not function as expected, consistently returning a "cannot fetch data" error. Despite multiple attempts and troubleshooting efforts, I was unable to retrieve data using the given API key.

To ensure the projectâ€™s completion and provide a functional demonstration, I downloaded the necessary movie data and created a moviesData.js file containing this information. I then utilized this local data file within the project instead of the API.

This approach allowed me to complete the assignment and achieve the desired functionality. If a new or corrected API key is provided, I would be happy to integrate it and update the implementation accordingly.

Thank you for your understanding. Please let me know if you have any further questions or require additional information.

Best regards,

Aditi Kolhe
